# Gesture-Controlled Virtual Mouse

This project implements a **gesture-controlled virtual mouse** using **Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe**.  
The system enables cursor movement and basic mouse operations through real-time **hand gesture recognition**, eliminating the need for physical input devices.


## Features
- **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Utilizes MediaPipe for accurate detection of hand landmarks.
- **Cursor Control**: Maps index finger position to cursor movement.
- **Mouse Operations**: Supports left click, right click, and drag operations through predefined gestures.
- **Optimized Performance**: Incorporates smoothing techniques to minimize cursor jitter and ensure low-latency operation.
- **Resolution Independent**: Functions consistently across different screen resolutions.



## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI
